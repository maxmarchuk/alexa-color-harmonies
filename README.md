# Alexa Color Harmony Skill
Ask Alexa for color harmonies!
### Description 
The goal of this project is to create an Alexa skill that will allow you to ask Alexa for various color harmonies for colors. An example phrase would be "Alexa, what's the complementary color for hex <some hex color code>".
The color harmonies I plan to add to this skill are:
* Complementary
* Split Complementary
* Triadic
* Tetradic
### Resources
I will be using the Alexa Skills API, AWS Management console, AWS Lambda, and an Amazon Echo for this project.
