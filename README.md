# alexa-color-harmonies
A project to familiarize myself with the alexa skills API and various Amazon Web services

The goal of this project is to create an Alexa skill that will allow you to ask Alexa for various color harmonies for colors. An example phrase would be "Alexa, what's the complementary color for hex <some hex color code>".
The color harmonies I plan to add to this skill are:
* Complementary
* Split Complementary
* Triadic
* Tetradic
