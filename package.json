An example phrase would be \"Alexa, what's the complementary color for hex <some hex color code>\". The color harmonies I plan to add to this skill are: * Complementary * Split Complementary * Triadic * Tetradic ### Resources I will be using the Alexa Skills API, AWS Management console, AWS Lambda, and an Amazon Echo for this project.",
